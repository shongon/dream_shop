# Dream-Shop: E-Commerce Website Demo

Welcome to **Dream-Shop**, an e-commerce backend demo project! This repository showcases a basic implementation of an e-commerce platform using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, and **JWT** for secure authentication. Through this project, I am building practical skills in the Spring ecosystem, preparing for a more advanced AI-integrated e-commerce project as my final school project.

## Project Overview

Dream-Shop serves as a foundational e-commerce backend that supports user management, product browsing, and order functionality. Here, I am experimenting with several key concepts, including **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** for structured data handling and **API testing** to ensure reliability and performance.

### Technologies and Concepts Used

- **Spring Boot** for streamlined web application setup and deployment
- **Spring Security** for managing authentication and authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure, token-based session management
- **DTOs** for efficient data transfer across different application layers
- **API Testing** to validate API endpoints and maintain system integrity

This project also reflects my first implementation of Spring frameworks, which will contribute to my final AI-enhanced e-commerce project.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with JWT-based session management.
2. **Product Management**: Full CRUD operations for managing product data.
3. **Order and Cart Management**: API support for creating and managing user orders and cart items.
4. **API Testing**: Unit and integration tests to ensure stability and reliability of the endpoints.
5. **DTO Pattern**: Implemented to enhance data handling efficiency across services.

## Future Goals

Dream-Shop is a preparatory step for my final project, where I aim to integrate AI features into an e-commerce platform. This project provides a foundation in secure, scalable backend development, preparing me to incorporate advanced AI functionality into an e-commerce environment.
